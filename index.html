        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>With a background spanning several years in finance I have developed a keen eye for detail, 
            analytical thinking & problem solving, with a strong appreciation for continuous improvement. 
            I am looking for an interesting role, which can keep my attention and can vary from day to day. 
            I believe there is always something to learn and real world education never truly ends.
            A competent and quick learner, I am always on the lookout for different roles from the norm & my previous experiences.
